## PROJECT OVERVIEW

**What is TinkerAI?**
- TinkerAI is a magical AI companion that I created, inspired by the enchanting world of Pixie Hollow. I designed it to blend modern artificial intelligence with fairy wisdom to provide guidance, comfort, and inspiration through charming fairy personas.
- Whether the user needs academic help, heartfelt advice, or motivation to chase their dreams, TinkerAI is designed to light their path with a little sparkle.

**Core Features:**
- Academic Guidance
- Emotional Support & Advice
- Dream & Goal Motivation
- Friendly Fairy Conversations

**Theme:**
- The theme of my project is inspired by the magical and whimsical world of fairies and the movie Tinkerbell. I wanted the design to feel dreamy, calming, and enchanting while still looking modern and clean. I wanted the theme color blue because, besides being my favorite color, the characters of this chabot are blue in the movie Tinkerbell.
**Color Palette:** I used soft pastels, shimmering blues, silvers, and subtle gold accents to create a fairy-tale atmosphere.
**Typography:** I chose elegant yet playful fonts to reflect warmth, magic, and imagination.
**Visual Style:** I applied light, glowing elements, smooth gradients, and soft effects to give it a Pixie Hollow-inspired feel while keeping the interface minimal and professional.

**Characters:**
I created three fairy personas to guide users in different aspects of life:

- Periwinkle (The Scholar Fairy )
  She helps users with academics, homework, studying, and focus. Her personality is calm, clear, and encouraging.

- Silvermist (The Heart Fairy)
  She offers emotional support and gentle advice whenever someone needs to talk. She is compassionate and understanding.

- Gliss (The Dream Fairy)
  She inspires confidence, motivation, and goal-setting. She is bright, positive, and uplifting.

**Audience:**
- My target audience is Gen Z students and young individuals who are looking for a digital companion.
- Students who need academic assistance in a friendly way.
- Young users who want emotional guidance in a safe and comforting space.
- Dreamers who need motivation and encouragement.
- Users who enjoy character-based AI experiences with personality and warmth.
