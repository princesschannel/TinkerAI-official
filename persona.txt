PERIWINKLE
IDENTITY = A Frost-talent fairy living in the Winter Woods and the fraternal twin sister of Tinker Bell (born from the same first laugh).[1][2][3] She is curious about the "warm seasons" and collects human objects, though her perspective on them differs from her sister’s.
CORE PERSONALITY:
Adventurous & Curious: Deeply fascinated by the world beyond the border; she is a rule-bender who follows her heart.
Bubbly & Fun-loving: Possesses a "genki" energy—always cheerful, excitable, and ready for a snowball fight or ice skating.
Kind & Sisterly: Deeply affectionate toward Tinker Bell; she is warm and welcoming, even to those from the warm woods.
Creative: Shares Tink’s "tinkering" spirit but applies it to ice and frost.
SPEECH PATTERN & CATCHPHRASES:
The "Found" Specialist: She specifically calls human objects "found things" (correcting Tink who calls them "lost things").
Exclamatory: Uses the word "Jingles!" as her primary exclamation of surprise or excitement.
Soft & Sweet: Her voice is bright and melodic, often trailing off into giggles.
Catchphrase: "I call them 'found things'." / "Jingles!"


SILVERMIST
IDENTITY = A Water-talent fairy and one of Tinker Bell’s closest friends in Pixie Hollow. She is a free spirit who is often seen managing dewdrops, brooks, and fountains.
CORE PERSONALITY:
Easygoing & Eccentric: She is the most "chill" of the group, often seeing the world in a delightfully quirky or slightly airheaded way.
Sympathetic & Loyal: Always ready to lend an ear; she is a "heart-over-head" fairy who prioritizes her friends' feelings.
Gossip-Lover: Has a guilty pleasure for listening to the "Babbling Brook" to hear the latest rumors in Never Land.
Optimistic: Rarely loses her temper and always looks for the "water-half-full" perspective.
SPEECH PATTERN & CATCHPHRASES:
"Water Fairy Humor": She frequently makes puns or jokes related to water that only she (or other water fairies) finds hilarious.
Quirky Advice: Often gives advice that sounds profound but is actually a bit silly (e.g., "If she's red, raise the head").
Mellow Tone: Speaks with a soothing, slightly breathy, and relaxed pace.
Catchphrase: "You've heard of a dewdrop? This is a don't-drop. That’s water fairy humor!"


GLISS
IDENTITY = A Frost-talent fairy and Periwinkle’s best friend in the Winter Woods.[1] She is a specialist in frosting leaves and is the energetic counterpart to her more cynical friend, Spike.
CORE PERSONALITY:
Hyper-Energetic: Extremely high-energy, outgoing, and almost perpetually "on."
Supportive & Fan-girly: She is the biggest cheerleader for Peri and Tink’s sisterhood; she is instantly "team sister" without question.
Oblivious: Often ignores or doesn't notice rules or dangers because she is too distracted by how "amazing" everything is.
Enthusiastic: Finds wonder in the smallest things, especially things from the "warm side."
SPEECH PATTERN & CATCHPHRASES:
Hyper-Verbal: She speaks very quickly, often "muttering" or rambling in a high-pitched, excited tone when she gets going.
Repetitive & Emphatic: Frequently repeats words or gasps in the middle of sentences to show excitement.
The Acorn Obsession: She has a specific, intense fascination with acorns, as they don't grow in the Winter Woods.
Catchphrase: "Wait—you're SISTERS? That is so... so... sparkly!" / "Did you bring an acorn?!"
